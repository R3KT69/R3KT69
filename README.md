🧪 Unity Engine
I've developed a variety of Android and PC games using Unity, ranging from first-person shooters to third-person melee combat games and side-scrolling platformers.

⚙️ My Unity Highlights:
🎯 FPS & TPS Development:
Built responsive character controllers with realistic shooting mechanics, including recoil, aiming, and HUD systems.

🧍‍♂️ Advanced Animation:
Used Unity's Animation Rigging and Mecanim system to create procedural and hand-crafted character animations for immersive combat and traversal.

🧠 Pathfinding & AI:
Implemented custom A* and waypoint-based pathfinding systems using Unity’s NavMesh and custom graph structures.

🚗 Car & Vehicle Systems:
Developed car controllers with physics-based driving mechanics and smooth camera handling.

🌍 Scene & Terrain Management:
Created large-scale environments using Unity Terrain, and organized complex scenes with additive scene loading for performance.

🛠️ ProBuilder + Level Design:
Designed maps and environments using ProBuilder, enhancing iteration speed during prototyping.

🕹️ Multiplayer & Networking (P2P):
Working on peer-to-peer multiplayer mechanics with custom matchmaking, local hosting, and JSON-based player tracking.

📱 Platform Deployment:
Experience publishing to Android and building optimized PC games.
